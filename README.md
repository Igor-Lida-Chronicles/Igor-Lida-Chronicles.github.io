All `.md` posts must start with the following snippet:

```
---
layout: post
title:  "The title of the post"
categories: [ jekyll ]
image: assets/images/image_name.png
featured: false
hidden: false
---

```

* `title` is the title of the post.
* `author`  is the nickname of the author (see previous step).
* `image` is the link to the featured image (e.g. assets/images/foo.png).  
* The `featured` and `hidden` takes boolean inputs (true/false) to set the visibility of the post and that of the featured image, respectively.

* IMPORTANT NOTE: Please avoid modifications to the layout of the snippet. The `categories` tag should always contain the '[ jekyll ]' entry.


After completing these steps, you can start creating the body your post.

* NOTE: As stated above, posts should be written in markdown language.
Once you are done with creating the post, please save it in the '_posts' folder by following the naming convention described above. Commit your changes and make a pull request.
