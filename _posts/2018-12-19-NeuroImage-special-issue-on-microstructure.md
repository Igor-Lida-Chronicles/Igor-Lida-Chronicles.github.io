Recently NeuroImage published the special issue on microstructure. The idea of creating this special issue was born after the workshop "Toward a Super-Big Brain: Promises & Pitfalls of Microstructural Imaging" organized by the Quebec Bio-Imaging Network, held in Montreal from 3-5 August 2016.
We are providing a collection of tweets about the papers in this special issue.
