Recently, NeuroImage published a special issue on microstructure. The idea of creating this special issue was born after the workshop "Toward a Super-Big Brain: Promises & Pitfalls of Microstructural Imaging" organized by the Quebec Bio-Imaging Network, held in Montreal from 3-5 August 2016.
This special issue contains 39 scientific articles encompassing both comprehensive reviews and original research. We collected all the tweets about the articles in one place to summarize this special issue.
