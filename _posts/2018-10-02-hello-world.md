With almost 40 years of successful use in clinics, magnetic resonance images (MRIs) are an indispensable part of a radiologist’s toolbox. Recently, a growing number of scientists are using MRIs to study different parts of the body, as well as how our body responds to external stimuli.

Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (qMRI) produces an arsenal of parameters that are informative about the underlying tissue properties. Compared to conventional MR, quantitative maps of these parameters provide a more direct link between the measured signal and the microstructural and biophysical characteristics of the target anatomy. Therefore, qMRI methods have been in the focus of attention of many independent longitudinal and cross-sectional neuroimaging studies aiming at developing objective biomarkers.

In their core, all qMRI methods share a common methodology: a numerical recipe (_qRecipe_) that relates a set of parametrically linked MR images (_qData_) to some microstructural and physical features. Bringing multidisciplinary expertise together, MRI scientists develop new _qData_ acquisition protocols and _qRecipes_ to advance what we can measure with MRI today.
To make it easy to share _qRecipes_, we developed qMRLab, an open-source software that aims to bring quantitative MRI under one umbrella. To learn about the technical details of qMRLab, please read our poster from this year’s annual ISMRM meeting. If you find the abstract too dense, then have an alternative explanation in a more lay language: Every MR Image is a Symphony, Every qMRI map is an instrument.

We believe qMRLab is an important step in this direction, providing a unified platform that researchers can use to fit their qMR data, simulate signals, and add customizable modules to fulfill the needs of the community. Currently, most labs use in-house code that is difficult to distribute and qMR studies are difficult to reproduce. By providing an open-source software package, coupled with a simple and easy-to-use graphical interface, we also hope to make these techniques accessible to a wider audience, and to help their translation into the clinic.
