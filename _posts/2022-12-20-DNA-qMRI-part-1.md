# A conventional analogy to genetics.

Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) is a medical imaging technique that lends itself very well to metaphors: it has previously been compared to a wide range of ideas and objects, from [jelly beans](https://agahkarakuzu.github.io/talk/talk15/) and [symphonic orchestras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67GKiK3iFr0), to [alphabet soups and Bento boxes](https://youtu.be/eaaHY_nl7tA). Continuing on with this tradition, we will now compare qMRI to something less unconventional in a science context: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing. There are many parallels to be made between neuroimaging and its sister field of genetics. Most neuroimagers are quite familiar with genetics as their training has exposed them, at the very minimum, to an overview of how to go from DNA to protein. And those with a heavy neuroscience background have likely had the misfortune to memorize a ghastly amount of transcription factors, DNA polymerases and ribosomal subunits to meet some course requirements. Whether overtly or not, most biological sciences are entrenched in genetic ideas and, elaborating on this further, we would like to make a point about how neuroimaging data science has drawn inspiration from the Human Genome Project (HGP) (Watson & Jordan, 1989).
