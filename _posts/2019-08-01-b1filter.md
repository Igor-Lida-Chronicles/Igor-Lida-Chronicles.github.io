excerpt: Widely considered the gold standard for T1 mapping, the inversion recovery technique estimates T1 values by fitting the signal recovery curve acquired at different delays after an inversion pulse (180°). In a typical inversion recovery experiment (Figure 1), the magnetization at thermal equilibrium is inverted using a 180° RF pulse.

Below is an interactive blog post about a new qMRLab module that we've developped. This post is powered by <a href="https://github.com/neuropoly/qMRLab" target="_blank">qMRLab</a>. Most figures are generated with <a href="https://plot.ly/python/" target="_blank">Plot.ly</a> – you can play with them by hovering your mouse over the data, zooming in (click and drag) and out (double click), and changing the drop-down options. To view the code that was used to generate the figures in this blog post, hover your cursor in the top left corner of the frame that contains the tutorial and click the checkbox "All cells" in the popup that appears.
