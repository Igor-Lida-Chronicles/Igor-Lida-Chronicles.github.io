title:  "New filtering module"
author: Mathieu

excerpt: Most studies that use B1 maps do not use the raw maps; instead, they are typically filtered during a pre-processing step to reduce effects like noise and minor artifact, as the B1 distribution in tissue is expected to be a smoothly varying function. However, there appears to be no clear community consensus

Below is an interactive blog post about a new qMRLab module that we've developped. This post is powered by <a href="https://github.com/neuropoly/qMRLab" target="_blank">qMRLab</a>. Most figures are generated with <a href="https://plot.ly/python/" target="_blank">Plot.ly</a> â€“ you can play with them by hovering your mouse over the data, zooming in (click and drag) and out (double click), and changing the drop-down options. To view the code that was used to generate the figures in this blog post, hover your cursor in the top left corner of the frame that contains the tutorial and click the checkbox "All cells" in the popup that appears. This blog post was generating using Jupyter Notebook running with a MATLAB kernel; details to run this on your local machine are  posted in <a href="https://github.com/qMRLab/notebooks/tree/b1filter" target="_blank">this GitHub link</a>.
