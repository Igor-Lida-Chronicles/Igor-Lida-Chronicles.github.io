This year, we organized a hackathon for MR professionals in Montréal just before ISMRM: <a href="https://mrathon.github.io" target="_blank">MRathon 2019</a>. Hosted at the Polytechnique de Montréal, it had over 50 participants spanning all five continents, and <a href="https://github.com/mrathon/idea-pitches/issues" target="_blank">nine idea pitches</a>, it ended up being a very productive event that sprouted several new collaborations and friendships.

This two-day event began with a series of four plenary talks to set the stage on a set of topics of timely importance for the MR community: reproducibility, standardization, and open source software.

The first plenary talk was by Paul Tofts, emeritus professor at the University of Sussex and author of the book <a href="http://qmri.org/" target="_blank">Quantitative MRI of the Brain</a>.

The second plenary talk was given by Katy Keenan, an MRI research engineer at NIST and lead author on a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.26982" target="_blank">recent review paper</a> quantitative MRI phantoms.

And the last plenary talk was by Daniel Gallichan, a lecturer at Cardiff University, current Past-Chair of the Reproducible Research Study Group, and project manager of the ISMRM-affiliated <a href="https://ismrm.github.io/mrhub/" target="_blank">MR-Hub</a> website listing open-source MRI software.
