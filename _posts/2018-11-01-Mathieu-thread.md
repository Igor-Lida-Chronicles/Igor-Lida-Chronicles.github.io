excerpt: Widely considered the gold standard for T1 mapping, the inversion recovery technique estimates T1 values by fitting the signal recovery curve acquired at different delays after an inversion pulse (180°). In a typical inversion recovery experiment (Figure 1), the magnetization at thermal equilibrium is inverted using a 180° RF pulse.

Last week we posted an interactive tutorial about <a href="https://qmrlab.org/jekyll/2018/10/23/T1-mapping-inversion-recovery.html">inversion recovery T1 mapping </a>. There are many hidden features in this post, so we created a Twitter thread to help you look under the hood
